# AES Encryption/Decryption Program
This Python program provides a command-line interface for encrypting and decrypting messages using the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm. It utilizes the cryptography library for AES implementation and provides options for encryption and decryption with ECB mode and PKCS7 padding.

### Features
1. Encrypt plaintext messages using AES encryption.
2. Decrypt ciphertext messages using AES decryption.
3. Supports ECB mode and PKCS7 padding for proper encryption and decryption.
4. User-friendly command-line interface with menu-based options.
5. Messages are displayed in hexadecimal format for easy copying and sharing.
### Requirements
1. Python 3.x
2. cryptography library (install using pip install cryptography)
### Usage
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the cryptography library by running pip install cryptography.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the program using the command python aes_program.py.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to encrypt or decrypt messages.
